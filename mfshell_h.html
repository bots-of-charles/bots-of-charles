Default value is zero so if you omit this argument, by default a single file is created<br>C = Password for encrypting the resulting file or parts<br><br>All files created are 7z files with zero compression. The reason why it does not apply compression is because the main goal of this command is to group or split files at a high speed regardless of the resulting size (the exact same as the files original files).

The solution to this is to use /mv or /bren for renaming depending on the situation. A classic solution to this problem before /bren existed was to create a subdirectory with a short name, move the files into that subdirectory, and then split it using /seven<br><br>The filename length and file size limitations are not set by the admin nor the bot, these limitations are set by Telegram, so there's no point in forcing it: an error related to it will happen one way or another</p>
